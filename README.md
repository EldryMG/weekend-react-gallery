[] To practice passing values through `props` in React, you will build the gallery using mulitple components - an `App`, `GalleryList`, and `GalleryItem`.
    - `App` - represents the overall application or site 
    - `GalleryList` - represents the gallery of images. By componentizing, we could reuse this component in different applications
    - `GalleryItem` - represents a single image in the gallery with the ability to click the image to toggle between image and description as well as the ability to like an image.
